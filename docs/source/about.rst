PyLaymon is a python based package which can be used for monitoring the layers of a neural network. The motivation behind this project was that while training a neural network, the user is not able to easily understand on what the network is actually learning. Therefore, a tool that can help monitor and visualize the layers of a neural network during the training process can help improve and understand the trained model better.

Currently, the package can be used to monitor and visualize the feature maps of a neural network. More functionality will be added in future.
The package currently supports the Pytorch framework.
